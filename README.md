# Cancer-Detection
Breast Cancer detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and classifying the data as either tumorous or benign

This project is implemented using different Machine Learning models - K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and XGBoost, achieving an average accuracy score of about 99%. Later, I configured a Feedforward Neural Network to compare with the previous models.
